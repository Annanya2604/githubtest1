Modes and Models in Project:
This project that I created was developed or written in PHP/MySQLi, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ajax and jQuery), Bootstrap, Admin LTE, and other plugins/libraries. In the system Admin Panel, admin users are required to submit their admin system credentials to access this side of the system. 
The admin users can manage the list of Categories, Sub-Categories, Book List, Inventory, and more. He/She is also in charge of managing the order list where he/she can update the status of each order. 
The admin also has the capability also to manage some information of the system such as the system name and logo. On the public/clients side, they can browse/explore the different kinds of types of books that the store is selling. 
The books are organized in each category and their subcategories. In the Navigation Bar, there are 3 Categories listed as the navigation and to show all the list of categories, the clients can simply navigate to the page by simply clicking the "All Categories" menu. 
On the book's view page, all the details of the selected book will be shown and this is the page where the customer can add the product to his/her cart. Talking about checking out or placing the customer orders, after clicking the "checkout" button at the cart list, the customer will be redirected to the checkout form where customer/client will choose if he/she wants to pick up or to deliver his/her order. 
The client can also choose his/her payment method for either "Cash on Delivery" and "Online Payment using PayPal". The system also generates a printable sales report.
